# DRdriver
This repository contains the genetic algorithm described in "DRdriver: identifying drug resistance driver genes using individual-specific gene regulatory network".
The files of network.txt and score.txt are examples for running the code. "network" is the individual-specific network. "score" contained intersected genes of candidate genes and regulators. This example belongs to TCGA-DB-A4XB in condition LGG_Temozolomide.
